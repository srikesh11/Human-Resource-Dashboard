# Human-Resource-Dashboard

This project is summarised in a series of articles that I have oublished on Medium. Go through the same.

The first article is about how to transform the data available as sheets in a .csv file for data analysis. Before moving ahead to analysing the data, the transformation is important (here combining data in multiple sheets into one). This process is completely dynamic and automated using parameters and functions in Power BI. Any extra sheet added to the .csv file will get reflected in the final dashboard automatically.

The next article is about how to create measures annd calculated columns in Power BI for data analysis. These measures are related to the performance goals/ KPIs that we want to see in the final dashboard.

The final article uses the measures, calculated columns and the existing columns to prepare a dashboard. The visualizations in the dashboard are arranged with proper sizing, formatting, spacing and coloring so that the viewer is able to see the information that is to be conveyed without any distraction.
